<h3> Communicate with your Lecturers</h3>
If for any reason you can't come to class, maybe you're sick, injured, going through a tough time or are getting behind in your work for some reason then the most important thing to do is tell your lecturers! They can help, they do understand, but they need to know what's going on.

<h3>Join the Facebook groups</h3>
Join the Facebook groups
The BIT Home, CITSS Home and CIT Home Facebook groups are used by staff and students alike to post news, updates about classes and assignments, useful links and information. Because everyone is in the group a really handy bonus is that you can ask for help any time of the day and you almost always get a prompt response from somebody.
