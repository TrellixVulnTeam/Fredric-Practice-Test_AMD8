In the Internet of Things (IoT) Dunedin group we love community engagement. We would love to hear from you if you have an idea suitable for LoRaWAN, if you have a question about any of our development projects and documentation, as well as any other general questions.

You can contact the project supervisor using the following email address:

`thomas.laurenson@op.ac.nz`
