Our team is made up of a group of friendly 3rd Year Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) students, with a couple of lecturers thrown in for good measure.

## 2018 IoT Project Team

The 2018 IoT Dunedin project group picked up the progress initially made by the 2017 team. They started their project with an in-place network infrastructure and a collection of documentation. However, they we tasked with the migration of all infrastructure to a new cloud computing platform. Additionally, they have been building off the work previously done with a focus on development of LoRaWAN nodes and web applications with advanced functionality. Additionally, they are currently developing a LoRaWAN solution for the Orokonui Ecosanctuary.

#### Matthew Jeffery

Currently a third year BIT student. My main interests are software development and information security. On the IoT team I have been contributing towards the GitHub pages website by adding/editing pages and converting team members documentation to markdown format. I have also conducted research to implement a straightforward tutorial on how to configure the LoRa Dragino Shield using Arduino.

#### Patrick Loots

Hi, my name is Patrick Loots and I am a 3rd year student studying IT at the Otago Polytechnic. My main interests are embedded systems and information security. On the IoT team I have done server security involving firewalls, ssh security and web application security. I have also done LoRa node configurations using Arduino as a prototype development environment.

## 2017 IoT Project Team

The 2017 IoT Dunedin project group started the journey of learning, designing, implementing and testing our free and open LoRaWAN network. The start was tough.. but after the first few months we hit the ground running. This team performed the research and testing that lead to the implementation of a LoRaWAN gateway and server infrastructure that is currently in use. Additionally, they developed a range of LoRaWAN nodes and web-based applications.

#### Oscar MacDonald

I am the server administrator for Dunedin IoT, which means ensuring the connection between nodes and the server, as well as between the server and the user. I enjoy the success of creating a solution to a problem. The entire process from learning and understanding the problem to implementing a solution is very satisfying.
