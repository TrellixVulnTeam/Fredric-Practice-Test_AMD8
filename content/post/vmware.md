The VMWare View client allows you to log in to the desktop you see on the Polytech PC's from your own machine over the internet. There are two desktops available - the standard Polytech desktop and one set up for ICT students which has some programming software, including Visual Studio 2013, installed onto it. You have access to everything as normal, but most importantly your H: drive. You can copy and paste files between your own pc and drives at Polytech allowing easy sending of your work and submitting of assessments.

We don't support local mode so don't bother downloading the local mode client. You may be tempted to log in to View, log into the ICT Desktop, and then fire up Visual Studio and start coding. We do not recommend this. It will be very slow and a loss of connection *may* cause you to lose work. Always work in locally installed applications and copy your work over when done.
