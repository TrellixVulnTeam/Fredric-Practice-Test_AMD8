As a student you get access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. The MSDNAA and VMWare web stores give you access to product keys and downloads of the ISO files containing the software. If you don't want to download all that data the ISO's are also available on the L: Software drive. You can simply copy the files onto a USB drive on a Polytech PC and take them home. It's free so why not use it?
